## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- TypeScript

### What I learned

Adding eventlisteners in plain Typescript with two or more arguments. Get more used to manipulate the DOM instead of building plain Java-/Typescript applications or working with React/Next.

### Continued development

I'm currently thinking about my SCSS aproach. I want to get more systematic, using variables and so on like in the flow class. 
More Mixin and extend-usage could reduce the needed effords in case maintainence too.

### Useful resources

- [Typescript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - Helped me out a couple of times with the eventlisteners
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Of course I searched something there too ;)
